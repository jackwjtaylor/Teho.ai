# Product Requirements – Teho.ai MVP

## Vision
Goal-driven AI canvas that turns outcomes into milestone/task plans and scaffolds artifacts in user storage.

## MVP Scope
1. Create a goal and generate a structured plan (milestones/tasks) via AI.
2. Create workspace structure and initial artifacts (plan.md, tasks.md).
3. Link tasks ↔ artifacts with provenance logging.
4. Storage adapters: Local (download zip) and Google Drive.
5. Export workspace (zip) and view artifacts in-app.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Repo builds and runs locally.
- Users can create a goal and see an AI-generated plan.
- Files created in selected storage; links available in the UI.
- Basic provenance logged; export works.
